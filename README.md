# Web Scraper

A simple web scraper using JS, Node.js, Express.

## Added Scripts

The script in the package.json file requires that nodemon is installed. nodemon is a devlopment tool for Node.js that automatically restarts the server when changes are detected in the files.

To install nodemon (globally): `npm i nodemon -g`

To run the script from the terminal: `npm run start`

Script: `"start": "nodemon index.js"`

## Other Notes

In this example I'm scraping a site that I made in 2017.
